//if processes between two middleware are killed, we can froze datas that are executed by scripting if the messages that themselves are generated in nanoseconds
//could stop running themselves. Then, there is a hole in ciphers that permit high scale digits datas. And then, it is not possible to stop
//running threads by only one os system if this system is rejected physically by eletronic chips. The best thing here to do with our asserts would be to communicate with
//all chips before programs contained in GDDR ram. Gddrram are then clamped by datas length. This nonsense here can be overcome if we send dummy messages before executing
//devkits programs, between chips. So, we need several shared pointers in a chaotic system.
